Hello!
You’ve downloaded Half-Helvetica by Jason Forrest. 

This typeface I consider to be a conceptual art-work. 
If used by itself, it’s an instant way to bring non-information to any text. If used twice, you get interesting design effects. Just play around with it - it’s pretty interesting.



But wait - there’s more! 
I’ve included the first issues of Curious Type - my new Typography zine! This shows off my first 6 fonts as well as some illustrations. There will be more issues with even more wonky fonts coming soonish. Maybe I’ll get a mailing list or a proper website set up by then, who knows.

You can download more fonts from my Bechance page (link below)
And drop me a line to say hello or show me something cool you’ve made with my fonts!

Have fun!
Jason Forrest
