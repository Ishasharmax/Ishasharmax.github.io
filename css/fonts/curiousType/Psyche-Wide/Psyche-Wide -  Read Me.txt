Hello!
You’ve downloaded Psyche-Wide by Jason Forrest. I was so stoked on this font that I made a cousin to it called Psyche-Serif, which is also on my Bechance Page. 
GO GRAB EEEET! 


But wait - there’s more! 
I’ve included the first issues of Curious Type - my new Typography zine! This shows off my first 6 fonts as well as some illustrations. There will be more issues with even more wonky fonts coming soonish. Maybe I’ll get a mailing list or a proper website set up by then, who knows.

You can download more fonts from my Bechance page (link below)
And drop me a line to say hello or show me something cool you’ve made with my fonts!

Have fun!
Jason Forrest
